✅ Prepared ${TAG} on branch ${TAG} — nothing pushed.

Next:
  git push origin ${TAG}
  # --body "" keeps the PR description blank (without it, gh pre-fills from your local git log).
  gh pr create --base main --head ${TAG} --title "chore(release): ${TAG}" --body ""
  # merging the PR triggers finalize-release.yml, which creates the draft GitHub release.
  # (to create it manually instead: python tools/prepare_release.py ${NEW_VERSION} --create-draft-release --target-repo <owner/repo>)
  # then review and click "Publish" on the draft release  ->  publish.yml  ->  PyPI
